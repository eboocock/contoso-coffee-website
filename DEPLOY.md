## ‚öôÔ∏è Power Automate Configuration

**Current Status:** The contact form has a Power Automate URL configured.

**To verify/update:**
1. Open `contact.html` in a text editor
2. Find line 158: `const FLOW_URL = "..."`
3. Verify the URL is correct
4. If needed, update with your Power Automate HTTP trigger URL

**Testing the integration:**
1. Fill out the contact form on the live site
2. Submit
3. Check your Power Automate flow run history
4. Verify data appears in Dataverse Leads table

**If Flow URL is not configured:**
- Form will download submission as JSON file (fallback behavior)
- This is expected and allows testing without Power Automate

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Contact page still shows demo button

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Wait a few more minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
- Check that the correct file was uploaded
- Verify Git push succeeded: `git log -1`

### Issue: 404 error on assets

**Solution:**
- Verify `assets` folder structure is correct
- Ensure `assets/img/` subfolder exists
- Re-upload the entire assets folder
- Check file paths in HTML (should be `assets/img/logo.svg`)

### Issue: Products not loading

**Solution:**
- Ensure `assets/enriched_products.json` was uploaded
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify file is in the correct location: `assets/enriched_products.json`

### Issue: Form doesn't submit

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify `FLOW_URL` is set correctly in `contact.html`
- Test with browser's developer tools Network tab
- If Power Automate fails, form should download JSON (fallback)
